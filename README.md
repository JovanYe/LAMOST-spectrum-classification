# LAMOST-spectrum-classification
On the task of classifying LAMOST DR9 spectra, including the three classes of 'GALAXY', 'QSO' and 'STAR'. Very necessary processing was done on the training data, including spectral normalisation, training sample equalisation, etc. Using a suitable integrated 1D CNN as a classifier, which performs well on the validation set without “collapsing”.  

#备注：
由于模型参数量稍大，现在条件下训练困难，因此对test数据集的结果暂时没有出来，待更新...
